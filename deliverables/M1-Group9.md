## 1. Executive Summary

```
Summary of project status and any changes that are
 planned for moving forward.
```
#### Moving Forward 
* In our last meeting, we decided to change our perspective to issues.Issues will be created after the meeting, so the person who opens issues will add more detailed information to issue’s description. The person who opens the issue will be the next person to the person who is writing the meeting notes at that week. We decided this because we were creating issues at the end of the meeting , so they were lack of important information because we were creating so many issues in a few minutes. The responsible person will take care of them and this will help to solve our problem we thought.

* The class and PS content will be analyzed in weekly meetings more thoroughly. So every person in the group will have the same amount of knowledge about what is going on in that week. We decided this because some people felt lack of knowledge about what was going on the project, we thought that this will solve this issue.

* As discussed in the classes, works will be divided into smaller parts after this week. So people can feel more responsible to other group members, generally it will increase the performance of each team member.We did this because when so many people assigned to same work, people did not feel responsible for the work, so some work completed late.

* Issues with dependencies will be given lower priority. For example mockups were depended on scenarios. We will assign more people to scenarios than mockups, so it will finish in shorter time. So the people which are creating mockups will work in reasonable time. We decided this because use case diagram and class diagram spend most of the time of the week so sequence diagram team couldn’t start the work which they did. They had very limited time so they put too much effort than other people.

## 3. Evalutation of Deliverables

### 3.1. Project Repo:

#### 3.1.1. Burhan:

 3.1.1.1. Resources title in the Sidebar should have its contents as subtitles. Currently you need to click on Resources to access it's contents.
 
 3.1.1.2. Projects of Sequence Diagram and Class Diagram are subtopics of Language Learning platform,not independent projects so they should not have their own project.
 
### 3.2. Project Documents:

#### 3.2.1. Burhan :

 3.2.1.1. Most of the documents contain a lot typos and grammatical mistakes. Documents should be proofread before being submitted.
 
 3.2.1.2. Assignment names or what they are about should be included in the Sidebar titles. Currently it is not clear what the assignments are and what are the subtitles are about without clicking on the assignment.
 
### 3.3. Issue Management:

 #### 3.3.1. Burhan:
 
 3.3.1.1. Issue labels are not updated according to progress made. There are issues with "Not Started Yet" tag that are completed and closed.

### 3.4. Requirements

 #### 3.4.1. Ali:
 
 3.4.1.1. Administration capabilities are so limited.They can/should be explained further, maybe add some more unique actions for this type of user.
 
 3.4.1.2. Overall requirements and glossary part are greatly partitioned and ordered.Nothing is unclear in considerable amount.

### 3.5. Mockups

 #### 3.5.1. Ali:
 
 3.5.1.1. In scenario 1.2 at the last image there may be included an option for seeing which questions are answered correct and which are not.
 
 3.5.1.2 There are some typos and mentions about expert type of user which is overstated that should not exist.
 

### 3.6. Design Documents

#### 3.6.1. Use Case Diagrams
 3.6.1.1. During the draft state of our use case diagram we had a very detailed use case diagram. It didn't only describe the basic funtionalities from the requirements, it also described the details of the features. After getting the feedback, we changed the use case diagram so it described more basic things. I think this version is easier to track and understand. It still can be considered a little too detailed but I think it is better. This way we can see everything in a picture. 
 
 3.6.1.2. Our use case diagram will be very helpful during the actual coding of the project. It helps seeing the requirements better. With the help of use case diagram, we can see what is expected from our project in a very easy way. I think it will prevent us from implemeting unrequired parts.  

#### 3.6.2. Class Diagram
 3.6.2.1. There were some mistakes and some some points that were missed in the draft of the class diagram. Also, interactions were shown in quite a complicated manner and there were too many classes. A much better class diagram has been created as a result of the corrections that were made in the light of the feedback received. Now the relations between the classes are clear and intelligible. A compacter diagram has been created by reducing the number of classes. Contents of the classes have become adequate owing to the methods that were added.

3.6.2.2. Our class diagram will be very useful for the project implementation part. We will easily see the classes that we will create and their attributes and methods. Naturally, methods in the class diagram will not be sufficient, we will add some other methods and attributes but at this stage our class diagram is enough to understand the general overview of the schematics of our project.
 
#### 3.6.3. Sequence Diagrams
3.6.3.1. First draft of the sequence diagrams were not satisfactory because of the timing problems. We give the most time to use case and then the class diagrams. So the first draft of the sequence diagrams were designed in a very short time. Despite to these facts, first draft of the sequence diagrams were good with respect to given time.

3.6.3.2. After feedbacks came from TAs, and the conversations about sequence diagrams in the class, our team put our best effort to design the sequence diagrams better. The number of diagrams tripled and the quality of the design became significant. Sequence diagrams will be our basis for the further development of our project.

## 5. Communication Plan
### Plan

|  Where | Who | Why | When|
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|:---------|
|[BM Lounge](#weekly-meetings)| Every Member|Weekly meeting, create plans|On Tuesdays at 19.00|
|[Hangouts](#Hangouts)|Whoever needs to|When a member cannot attend the weekly meeting|When Needed|
|[Slack](#slack)|Every Member|Regular Communication|Always|
|[Github](#github)|Every Member|Public Discussion|Always|
|[Whatsapp](#whatsapp)|Every Member|In emergency situations|Always| 

### Details

#### Weekly Meetings
Because talking and discussing usually results better than any other communication, we will meet once a week and discuss the next steps that we should take to make our project better.

#### Hangouts
Because it is hard for each 10 team member to be present in the weekly meetings,  we thought that we would need a video conference channel. Through the Hangouts, the people that are out of town can attend the weekly meeting and tell their ideas.

#### Slack
Sometimes, when doing the assignments of the week, we may need to discuss our results. To discuss these online, we chose to use Slack because of its nice design that allows us to open new channels according to the topic of the discussion. Also, when the code is shared through the Slack, it looks better than other available texting apps.

#### Github
Github is a very good place to do a group project because each contributor to the project can see the latest version of the project. Also, the old versions are kept safe in the memory of the Github to be used whenever needed. There are many functions of Github like issues, tags that are useful to develop a project and make it easy to communicate with the other developers.

#### WhatsApp
WhatsApp is a widely used texting app. Each group member uses WhatsApp frequently and usually checks it multiple times a day. Because of this, we decided to open a WhatsApp group to communicate on emergency situations as it makes it easy and fast to connect to other group members.

* Bad at vocabulary
* Wants to improve her daily conversations skills
* [Scenario about Aslı](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group9/wiki/User-Scenarios-and-Mock-ups#scenario-1)

Aslı is a 20-year-old university student at Bogazici University. French was the second language that is taught in her high school and she really enjoyed French till then. When she started university, because of her schedule she couldn't take the French class and be very disappointed about it. She couldn't afford to go to a private course for the language as they were quite expensive in Istanbul. She thinks that without practice, it is easy to forget about a language and lose your fluency and she doesn't want that to happen to her as she loves learning French. She thinks that she is on level B2 thanks to her high school education but there is a possibility of decreasing because she couldn't study French during her summer holiday. Until the next semester that she can take an official course, she wants to keep improving herself in French. She thinks her weakest area is vocabulary as she finds it hard to memorise things. Also, she wants to improve her daily French skills as she wants to do Erasmus in France and thinks that it is important to improve her life there.

### 8.4. Diagram Reviews
#### 8.4.1. Use Case Diagram Review 1
## Review 1 by Egemen

Hi, I made a list of things that came to my mind, they are by no means the last words and most of them should be considered by looking and/or modifying the diagram and the requirements simultaneously. Very good work :)

1. In the use case `Enter credentials`, do we know that these info are precisely what we want/need, nothing less nothing more? For example, do we need to require the birth date?
1. `Display demo exercises` use case should be detailed.
1. Do `Verify suggested learning materials` get done by the admins or users?
1. `Grade assignments` and `Give feedback` use cases look like they are the `include`s of another use case.
1. `Add suggested tags` may be a different use case on its own.
1. At `See the progress for each language` use case, does it matter that we show all the languages' progress or a single one's? Do we need to emphasize this?
1. `Interact with another user` use case can be demonstrated better if we use another stick figure for the other user so diagram shows an interaction between users, rather then simply reads.
1. We need to make sure that when we say`Reach learning materials` and `Select ... materials`, we are comfortable with the verbs of action here. These words are very sticky, do we convey the right info when we use them?
1. `Do assignments` use case needs to be under `Writing` use case. Again, we can use another stick figure on that part of the graph.
1. I cannot remember if we talked about `Take exercises about the notes` use case. Is there any exercise for the notes? Should there be?
1. After taking the proficiency exam, what happens? For example, at what point, the learning materials which were not accessible, become so?
1. `Admin user` should be able to interact with other users, should be able to learn a new language. In the [UML Use Case Diagram Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zid-MVo7M-E), there was a technique which looks like "OO inheritance". We can use that to differentiate between normal users and admins, all the while providing to the admins with every service we already provide to the users.

#### 8.4.2. Use Case Diagram Review 2
## Review 2 by Egemen

1. In `Rate Each Other` use case, it may be better to just say `Rate` or `Give Rating`.
1. I am still unsure about the info we require at the registering process. Also, Google or Facebook sign-ins should be considered.
1. `Get Feedback From An Expert On The Language` use case should be renamed to `Get Grading From Another User`. Where does getting feedback use case fit in, I do not know. Let's not use 'expert' word, and split feedback into grading and feedback. `Rate The Reviewer` and `Comment On The Reviewer`
1. Is `Take Exercises About The Notes` use case necessary, I do not know. If it is not necessary, let us remove it.
1. Maybe `Select A New Language` is more appropriate here. But then, users can only take proficiency at the selection, which is not correct behavior. I am unsure.
1. Can admins learn a language? Can they do or grade assignments? If yes, then diagram must be modified.

#### 8.4.3. Class Diagram Review 1
## Review 1 by Halit

These are the list of things I believe we should talk over to improve the Class Diagram Draft.
These questions/suggestions are not final, and will most possibly be proceeded by more reviews. 

#### General Structure
1. Why are unidirectional associations used in almost everywhere instead of bidirectional ones.
2. Why are most classes separated into a `normal` version and a `controller` version.

    2.1. How about merging `Review` and `ReviewController`?
    2.2. How about merging `WritingExercise` and `WritingExerciseController`?
    2.3. How about breaking up `LearningMaterialController` and merging 
    its parts with `LearningMaterial`, `Tag` and other classes.

#### Numbers

1. Why are some numbers missing about associations?

    1.1. `LanguageController` one to many `Language`         

#### Diagram / Shapes
1. Why is it that two different ways to represent an arrow head is used?
(-> and -▶) According to the resources I've checked, they mean the same thing, unidirectional association.
If the `composition interaction` was meant, it should be shown as `-♦` not as `-▶`

#### Typos ?
1. `RegiteredUserController` => `RegisteredUserController`
