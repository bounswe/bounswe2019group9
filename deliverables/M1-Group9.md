## 3. Evalutation of Deliverables

### 3.1. Project Repo:

#### 3.1.1. Burhan:

 3.1.1.1. Resources title in the Sidebar should have its contents as subtitles. Currently you need to click on Resources to access it's contents.
 
 3.1.1.2. Projects of Sequence Diagram and Class Diagram are subtopics of Language Learning platform,not independent projects so they should not have their own project.
 
### 3.2. Project Documents:

#### 3.2.1. Burhan :

 3.2.1.1. Most of the documents contain a lot typos and grammatical mistakes. Documents should be proofread before being submitted.
 
 3.2.1.2. Assignment names or what they are about should be included in the Sidebar titles. Currently it is not clear what the assignments are and what are the subtitles are about without clicking on the assignment.
 
### 3.3. Issue Management:

 #### 3.3.1. Burhan:
 
 3.3.1.1. Issue labels are not updated according to progress made. There are issues with "Not Started Yet" tag that are completed and closed.

Evaluation of the status of deliverables and its impact on your project plan

### 3.4. Requirements

### 3.5. Mockups

### 3.6. Design Documents

#### 3.6.1. Use Case Diagrams
 3.6.1.1. During the draft state of our use case diagram we had a very detailed use case diagram. It didn't only describe the basic funtionalities from the requirements, it also described the details of the features. After getting the feedback, we changed the use case diagram so it described more basic things. I think this version is easier to track and understand. It still can be considered a little too detailed but I think it is better. This way we can see everything in a picture. 
 
 3.6.1.2. Our use case diagram will be very helpful during the actual coding of the project. It helps seeing the requirements better. With the help of use case diagram, we can see what is expected from our project in a very easy way. I think it will prevent us from implemeting unrequired parts.
