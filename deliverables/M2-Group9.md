We are designing a product, which will be used to teach, learn and make exercises on languages. Mainly, it is a language learning platform. This project is assigned to us by the instructor of the course CmpE 352 in Spring 2019. Our project mainly consists of two parts: designing the project on an abstract level and implementation.

Our team has ten members: Irem, Ibrahim, Arda, Burhan, Egemen, Emirhan, Gamze, Halit, Ahmet and Ali. We are all bunch of friends taking that course simultaneously.

The work done before our first Milestone can be found in the [Milestone 1 report ](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group9/blob/master/deliverables/M1-Group9.md). After our Milestone 1, we produced two more deliverables. Project plan and API implementation for our project plan. 

The project plan is the diagram that we plan what we have done and what we will be doing in the next steps of our project. The project plan is a dynamic deliverable as the project evolves, the project plan gets updated too. 

Our API implementation has currently 9 mini API functionalities in it: Object detection, movie recommender, language detection from text, language detection from the location, word of the day, translation, text to speech, tag detection and inappropriate word detection.

For the future, we are planning to add a front-end to all the API functionalities. Also, as a group, we decided to learn about Web and Android basics to be able to implement the whole project. After learning the basics, we will be forming sub-teams for Web, Android and backend. Then we will be implementing the project. Our far future plans are not exactly determined yet but those are our main expectation from the future.

Of course, during our project, we met many challenges as a group.
* The first challenge was the communication. While doing group work, communication between members is the most important thing. Especially between the first milestone and now, we had many difficulties with communication. We were not able to meet as a whole group for a long time during our meetings and while doing our personal share of the teamwork, when some group members didn't do their part without informing the other members, we were not able to complete the whole assignment.
* The second challenge was about the division of the teamwork. When giving the members some weekly work, we weren't able to divide the whole job properly. This caused some jobs to be left without an assignee and left the job to the initiative of other group members.
* The third challenge was a more technical challenge. During the implementation of our API, many group members had hard time as we haven't implemented any API before and we didn't know about it. That's why some of the group members were not able to complete their parts. We tried to learn about a whole new concept so it was quite hard and challenging.

After facing those difficulties and trying to solve them as good as we can, we are more experienced as a group. We hope to face fewer problems in the next stages of our project.

#### Project Plan 

* The project plan has been helpful for observing the overall view and progress of our project. 
* The start and finish dates of the tasks were not stated properly. We tried and fixed this problem as much as possible. Due to the date problem of Project Libre, those dates on it may not be the actual dates.
* In overall, most of the tasks stated in correct order but a few tasks are missing. For example, after getting feedback from customers, we nearly recreated the sequence diagrams.
* Milestones are included in the plan. 
* Adding additional predecessors while defining new tasks will be better. For example, in Implementation/Android/Testing part should have a predecessor like Implementation/Android/Functional Implementation .

#### API Implementation 

* The overall structure of the API seems fine. It works end-to-end, from the opening the issue to merging the pull request. But also it has some deficiencies. 
* The functionalities of the API has no front-end part (except translation part), they only return json file. There should be a simple front-end part which can show the functionality of that part.
* There should be 10 functionalities but it seems only 9 functionality exist. The last one should be added. 
* The number of test cases can be increased.

### Communication
##### Slack 
* We mainly used Slack for in-group communication. At first we had a lackluster experience but once we got used to it, it worked fine.
* Slack's functionalities made us easy to communicate and share amongst ourselves.
##### Whatsapp
* We mostly used whatsapp for emergencies. When someone had an issue that needed immediate attention,(s)he used Whatsapp group.
* We didn't want to use Whatsapp as our main communication app since most people used Whatsapp for personal affairs.
##### Hangouts
* We never used Hangouts during this semester as it was not really needed.

###  Process Management
##### Github
* Github was our main tool for everything related to project management. We uploaded project documents and meeting notes to wiki page. Everything we did can be found in our repo's wiki page.
* We have some problems related to Issue followups. We still have 15+ issues open, some of them are almost a month old. In the future we need a better system to make sure issues are done within their assigned timeframes.
 
### Evaluation of Processes
##### Weekly Meetings
* We held a group meeting every week in BM Lounge on Tuesdays. After the first weeks we rarely had all 10 members of our group present in the meetings. In the future we may need a better meeting schedule. 
* During the meetings we wasted a lot of time understanding what the assignment of week was about. We need to prepare before the meetings in the future.
* Discussions of our meetings were not really efficient. Instead of just distributing the workload we tried to tackle the issues during the meeting which slowed us down significantly. Most of our meetings lasted much longer than the intended 1 hour. But in time, we had more and more efficient meetings, in terms of time.

### Database
In production environment MySQL (MariaDB) is used, in development environment SQLite is used.

### Running on your local machine

You should prepare a `secret.json` file that contains below fields:
```json
{
  "SECRET_KEY1": "series of random characters",
  "SECRET_KEY2": "series of random characters",
  "SECRET_KEY3": "series of random characters",
  "DB_NAME": "mysql db name",
  "DB_USER": "mysql db user",
  "DB_PASSWORD": "mysql user password",
  "STATIC_ROOT": "root folder for collectstatic command"
}
```

# Usage
### _6.1. Movie Recommendation_
---
For your questions, please contact the developer, [Arda Baris Budak](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group9/wiki/Arda-Bar%C4%B1%C5%9F-Budak)

Returns name and year of a random movie. 

Url extension: `/rec/<language_code>`

##### Example
`rec/en`
```json
{
"movie_name": "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", 
"movie_year": "1989" 
}
```

language_code should be one of `en, de, tr`  for English, German, and Turkish respectively.

### _6.2. The Word of the Day_
---
For your questions, please contact the developer, [Ahmet Gedemenli](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group9/wiki/Ahmet-Gedemenli)

Returns the word of the day with its meaning, in any of the supported languages.

The respond you get will, of course, differ every day.

Url extension: `/wordoftheday/<language_code>`

##### Examples
`wordoftheday/en`
```json
{
	"word": "Efficient",
	"definition": "Achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense."
}
```

`wordoftheday/tr`
```json
{
	"word": "Niyet",
	"definition": "Bir şeyi yapmayı önceden isteyip düşünme, maksat."
}
```
`wordoftheday/aq`
```
NO SUCH LANGUAGE AVAILABLE
```

### _6.3. Object Recognition_
---
For your questions, please contact the developer, [Irem Uguz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group9/wiki/Irem-Uguz)

Takes a picture and recognizes the objects in that picture with the correction percentage and returns an Json object with that data. This can be used in our project to help the users learn the vocabulary of the object in that picture.

Url extension: `/obj/<picture_url>`

##### Return Content:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "classifiers": [
        {
          "classifier_id": "default",
          "name": "default",
          "classes": [
            {
              "class": "<Object Name>",
              "score": <Score of the object>,
              "type_hierarchy": "<Type of the object>"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "source_url": "<Url of the image>",
      "resolved_url": "<Url of the image>"
    }
  ],
  "images_processed": 1,
  "custom_classes": 0
} 
```
  
  Class means basically the name of the object in the picture, score is how confident the object detection is about the classification. Also the api doesn't return any classification that has a score that is less than 0.5. Type hierarych is the bigger classes that the class of the object belongs to. For example a dog is an animal too. Custom classes papameter will always be 0 for our api as we use the classes that are built-in in the watson-object-detection api which is the api that I am using for this case. Images processed will be one as we are giving single image to the api. Source url and resolved will be the same as well.

##### Example

  "to": "to-language-code",
  "source": "text-to-be-translated" 
}
```
