Requirements Elicitation (Continued)


A. Scenarios:

Write three scenarios for your project by clearly describing:

1) The user and their persona (role)
2) Preconditions -- if any (such as: the user that has already logged in).
3) Specific actions to achieve a desired goal (what the user wants to do).  Describe each step until the scenario is completed. Steps must be enumerated.

4) Acceptance criteria (the conditions that describe a successful outcome for the action)

IMPORTANT: Your user scenarios must be based on realistic user and content. Do not use sign up or login as scenarios.


B. Mockups:

Create mock-ups for the user scenarios (from end to end) that you described in PART A.
Your mockups must present concrete examples as discussed in class.
Remember that, the goal is to get into the mindset of the customer as much as possible. Thus, creating mockups that will foster a shared context with the user will be most effective.

You may draw a wireframe or use any drawing application to produce the scenarios.

All material will be shared on your project repository.
